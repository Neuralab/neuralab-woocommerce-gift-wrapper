# Neuralab WooCommerce Gift Wrapper

Christmas season is pretty tense for every store owner. Much like Santa’s workshop, you need to take care of all the nuts and bolts - working with suppliers, packaging, shipping, double checking customers addresses and inspecting your own warehouse stock... A ton of work for sure.

One little detail that often goes forgotten is **gift order wrapping**. Customers want to complete the entire purchase on your eCommerce store and they also want to be “done with it”. That includes wrapping the products in some nicely designed cloth or paper.

Here’s where Neuralab development elves enter place! They’ve built a custom plugin for WooCommerce that handles optional gift wrapping on the customer’s checkout page. It was fabricated with our **Clean & Simple** methodology in mind - the plugin does one thing and does it really well.

As for the settings, you can enter the wrapping price and decide whether the WooCommerce tax rates apply to this price or not. Plugin is translatable and we have included PO files to easily add language translations. Currently we have translations for Croatian and English language. 

You can examine the source code on BitBucket and install it freely on your WooCommerce store (installation follows rudimentary WordPress plugin installation so you should be done in a couple of clicks).

Santa’s **roadmap** for this plugin includes working on better integration of plugin into the WooCommerce settings tabs, support for configurable prices & tax rates and even choosing the type of wrapping.

**Watch out for developers wisdom ahead:**

- Plugin requires WooCommerce version: 3.0
- WooCommerce integration is tested up to version: 3.2.6
- Requires WordPress Version: 4.4
- WordPress tested up to: 4.9.1
- Minimum PHP version: 5.2

Happy coding & happy holidays!
